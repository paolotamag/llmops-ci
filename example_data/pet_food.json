        "response": "Hi Alex, excellent question! DCM concerns are primarily documented in dogs, with limited evidence in cats. Our Grain-Free uses peas and potatoes as carb sources, while Ancient Grains includes quinoa, millet, and chia seeds. Both are nutritionally complete. For cats, the choice often depends on digestive sensitivity rather than DCM risk. Tiger's doing well on grain-free, so switching isn't necessary unless he shows issues. I can send you the latest veterinary research on DCM in cats if you'd like to review it.",
